# ESET-219
#This is a repository of all the labs I have completed this past semester (Fall 2023) for ESET 219 at Texas A&M. Quartus Prime was used as the software, and the DE10-Lite board was used as the hardware.
#
#If you're in ESET 219 right now, please do not look at these labs, the Aggie Honor Code likely forbids it. Plus, there's always the good chance that the labs have been changed, or that you don't have the 
#same professor that I took. Also, most labs won't blindly work without some tinkering when trying to demonstrate them, due to the nature of how the files are organized, so just don't try haha
#However, I will wish you luck in the course üëç
#
#To anyone else seeing this, I hope that I have demonstrated even a little bit of what I have learned in ESET 219, although the concepts and strategies learned in this class go far beyond just the labs.
